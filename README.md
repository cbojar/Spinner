# Spinner

This is a simple project to create "spinners", which are essentially iterators
over a range of characters. Spinners can be nested to iterate through all
combinations of a series (such as all binary representations of a byte).
Spinners are written in an abstract manner, and so can be mixed and matched
to generate whatever series a developer would like.
